# Computer-Recording-and-Activity-Playback
You'll need some dependencies installed. I'm on the Hirsute Hippo update for Ubuntu, from the command line I did:

```
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install pynput
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install SpeechRecognition
```
Now you can run the script from the terminal. When you run the script, the box in the top left appears labelled 'Computer Record. Here you can click 'Record':

After naming your save file (or leave the name blank to name it with a timestamp), you can then click 'Replay' in order to replay your recording:

This is a basic example, but more complex examples are on the way. I downloaded a couple hundred songs from Youtube Music and an MP3 Downloader site using this method. This application could be useful if you don't know how to code, but do know how to use a desktop computer interface. Drag and drop no code software is interesting and useful, but it has limited options. Furthermore, Computer Recording and Activity Playback leverages the universality of the mouse and keyboard interface.
