# Computer-Recording-and-Activity-Playback
This is my best project yet. More to come. Gonna add documentation and a video, and I hope to get some help with this.

You'll need some dependencies installed. I'm on the Hirsute Hippo update for Ubuntu, from the command line I did:

'''
pip3 install pyautogui
pip3 install pynput
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install SpeechRecognition
'''
